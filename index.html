      <p><b>The first modules rain down onto the surface. Hardy trained scouts are spreading across the surface accompanied by their MULEs. The monolithic structure hanging in the air overseeing this all is a mutli-purpose high orbit space station <i>Transtar</i> that controls the operation.

      <span style="opacity: 50%;">0 years after contact</span>
      <p><b>The moment of the discovery of the new species split the calendar in two, we were treading on someone else's homeland. The landlords of the forests and mountains. Our people called them Druids in reference to an old folklore legend. But the first contact ended up in a misunderstanding that resulted in the loss of life for both sides. Now an old quarry stays there as the memorial, appropriately called Point of Contact</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="card season">
      <h1>Season 1</h1>
      <span style="opacity: 50%;">Spring. 1 year a.c.</span>
      <p>The location for the new colony was picked to quickly re-base away from the point of contact. And by this point every bit of infrostructure was falling appart, ready to blow up and kill hundreds and suffocate thousands.</p>

      <p>A small group of scientists scavenged themselves a laboratory from old living modules and cargo containers, tacked on to a barn in the field under the farming dome. What was different about these enthusiasts was the unusual neighbors they brought with them. Florans, feral plant-like creatures who despite their appearence were extremely violent and chaotic, but the Supervisor knew that they too had their uses. </p> 

      <p> A wave of surveys and inspections were made to figure out exactly what screws went loose and how to screw them back in place. The main threat was the "Melting Core", a name  people gave this beast of a construction. But its size did not translate to its longevity. This fusion reactor is feeding life into every corner of the colony, but its walls are falling apart, the moss is creeping, and equipment started to cover in rust. It was a ticking time bomb, leaking radiation into the slums. </p> 

      <p> Ecologists sounded the alarm and forced the hand of management to address the issue, and then returned later for a full renovation of the place, using florans to reach places deep in the machinery, using their reverse-engineering abilities to lick the place clean. Discovering a weird moss along the way, that was the main problem of ageing. The energy flow was restored finally making power outages the thing of the past. But at a cost... one of the valuable trained florans went missing and nowhere to be found, still remains a threat to civilians in the domes.</p>

      <p>On the other side of the fence, Sacred were dealing with the aftermath of the arrival. Sickness spread among those who never knew such suffering before. They took the opportunity to trade with expeditions passing by, supplies and devices in exchange for artefacts and weird rocks. A small group of went rogue, took the weapons aquired in trade, and used them against the invaders to make a message. </p> <p> The council of the elders took their damn time to wake up to the changes, and when they did it was too late, all the aforementioned problems seeped into every part of their society. The Keeper herself traveled to the borderlands to meet the rogues in person, to speak, connect and address their suffering, where she met a group of researchers who came to talk. Problems brought by the arrival were addressed and Ecologists offered help, setting up the Neutral Grounds camp to freely share information and supplies between two parties. </p> <p> The keeper then went from settlement to settlement, rallying people to wake up to the threats, stay strong against the aliments and stay true to the code of nature. She embarked on an epic pilgrimage towards The Flicker to connect back to mother earth. Meawhile her servants welcomed visitors and resolved deals on her behalf, routing resources to the ones in need.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile somewhere in the colony your radio can catch a faint signal playing music of the old world. A radio station buried under the piles of colony infrastructure god knows where, filled with archives of the classic songs that make your blood boil with life. The people listened, endured and continued to build the foundation for the home away from home. Convicts, indebted, poor, ill, crazy. Scum of the earth. </p>

      <p> A if their needs not be addressed by the company, someone will. And someone did, a cell of talented dealbrokers and wiseguys stepped out to protect their families and take back the power. They set up a false front organisation Manna through which they smuggled supplies for those who need them, but the deal went awry and the organisation had to stay low for a while. But the supplies did nto stop coming, a secret chemical laboratory underground was setup to keep the people alive, and their chemist, an unusual blue skinned floran named Fom, working day and night to perfect the formula. The packaged gifts were sent out to many in need, even to druids. The network of radio relays was growing, allowing the ones on it to communicate off the grid, not silenced by the censorship. </p> <p> The Drilling Facility was the heart of the labour and people were misstreated gravely. Fom had to do something. Pulling all the strings an equipment shipment was sent out but something went wrong. An explosion in the water pumps led to panic, reveal of the intruders, and then riots broke out. But somehow, by sheer miracle, nobody got killed. A peaceful protest rippled through all social levels building Scum the support they needed to create the Union of labour.</p>

    <div class="card season">
      <h1>Season 2</h1>
      <span style="opacity: 50%;">Summer. 1 year a.c.</span>
      <p>As the dust from the facility takeover settled, the domes gradually transitioned into summer. A number of outside deaths were registered from people just cooking inside their suits, so the frequency of scout operations decreased significantly.</p>

      <p>The ecologists took the season's initiative first. Work at the neutral camp was boiling. Discoveries, good and bad. From the good ones, alien biology was finally mapped out and categorized, increasing the efficiency of treatment. But on the other hand, the intrusion into the delicate ecosystem backfired. Many sacred citizens were coming back with increased symptoms.</p>

      <p>Next on the list was the ecosystem itself, the thing they were hired to research. On such occasion Transtar offered a lucrative support contract. Teams of floran hunters were trained and instructed to capture species alive for study, which worked nicely right until they found a hunter worthy of their prowess, all the non lethal training was ignored immediately, in favour of a good old game of brutal survival. This sparked an idea, ecologists think they found a key to survival in these harsh lands, and so they defied all precautions, diving head on into unknown science.</p>

      <p>In the facility meanwhile a total bureaucratic chaos took over the offices as the management shifted, it took some time for Fom and her friends to get used to the new responsibilities. They lost their home, as the company started cutting their bridges for them, harassing their friends and pigeonholing them into the new role. Scum did not take it though. An explosion echoed through the domes, delivering an impactful message for all who listened the news that day.
      </p>

      <p>But veiled from everybody’s eyes, the history was made behind a jungle walls. As the Keeper's pilgrimage continued, she returned from the long journey with a revelation. A plan. Laid out on paper it was called a Foundational Pact. Although  it was quite a radical move that no one has every tried before in the lineage of keepers, and they resisted the change, but this Keeper was confident.</p>

      <p><b>The satellite launch, it served quite a few purposes. Firstly its construction process brought many minds together to make it come true. Secondly, it was a beacon addressed to the Embassy by Nulu and Supervisor, fulfilling their mission. Who will answer the call?</b></p>

      <p><b>At the same time the strength of the colony did not stop growing. Drilling Facility's walls stand proud in defiance of nature, but its getting eaten from the inside. Anxiety and fear, creatures and wear, all manners physically and metaphorically. How long will it hold?</b></p>

      <p><b>The Sacred mustered their own walls, walls of scouts, guards and messengers, that tie and define the borders, keeping a steady hand on the pulse of colonists whereabouts. Important changes were made to how the nation treats the invaders, tight control was put on how, where, with who and under what supervision conversations between races happen.</b></p>

      <p><b>Communication is the key. As all stakeholders adjusted their bearings, communication and research became the priority, as the opponents carefully studies each other. And it was going relatively smoothly. Right until the barrier was struck, the barrier of understandable nature, and beyond it is the world of myth and ether. The energies surged from under control of the researchers, polluting the farmlands nearby and destroying the crops, and giving a small tribe of lab-grown florans a window of opportunity that they took to break out, scattering into the surrounding regions. And as such, a new threat emerges.</b></p>

      <p><b>But Ecologists did not disappear just like that. Nulu's legacy of research still lives on in other's work. Who knows what hands it will end up in.</b></p>

      <h1>Season 3</h1>
      <span style="opacity: 50%;">Autumn. 1 year a.c.</span>
      <p>Colony barely skimmed the possible food crisis that could have happened because of the damage done to the Farm Domes. Scum invested alot of their resources to make sure it gets repaired well, as well as built an entirely different facility in place of the point of contact. Getting familiar with Druidic trading they have acquired a certain degree of trust.</p>

      <p>A miracle happened there. Just before the Farm Dome fell. Sacred bestowed their blessing on the souls of the lost in the First Contact. Giving them new bodies and new lives. Transformation did not leave their minds intact, but it is the price they have to pay to be born again. They were called the Reclaimed. Souls saved by Druids, bodies built by colonists. They settled in the farming gardens on the former point of contact, performing an important task of keeping the colony alive and fed. They called this place Gardens of Osiris. For the rest of the season Sacred retreaded from active confrontation, mediating inner conflicts and stabilizing their empire.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile florans found place to stay deep into the southern jungles, a week could not go by without them causing trouble to the colonists. First major raid could be counted as the junkyard raid where under the cover of the night they disassembled a dozen of ships for parts, seeking out vital irreplaceable systems. Second raid was on the colony itself. The damage done by the raid was a little tricky to pinpoint. Warehouse fire released a poisonous cloud into Dome's air circulation system. Deep-diving miners have been found to have crystal tumors as a result of poisoning. Other demographics remained largely unharmed.</p>
