            <p>A name the people gave this beast of a construction. But its size did not translate to its longevity. This fusion reactor is feeding life into every corner of the colony, but its walls are falling apart, the moss is creeping, and the equipment starts to get covered in rust. Its a ticking time bomb.</p>

Their weapons are a mix of their homeland trickery and Transtar weaponry, fused together they make a deadly mix</p>

            <p>It was a temporary solution. But we all know how that goes. It was a farming barn standing in the wheat field under the colony's dome that was repurposed for an Ecologist community to use as an HQ. It now looks like a mess of modules taped together with a workaround upon workaround. The cast of characters here is as chaotic as the building itself. Humans and Florans working together to come up with solutions to world's problems.</p>

      <p>
        <b>The planet is in the last stages of ecosystem formation, this is an ideal opportunity to study and integrate civilization into its circulation. Unfortunately, this also means that the planet has bared its teeth and is ready to bite. The climate, although acceptable, is extremely contrasting from biome to biome, and the atmosphere, although is similar enough to breathe, not for very long. Volcanic activity is in the withering phase, which means that a huge amount of deposits and minerals have just formed not so deep below the surface.</b>

      <b><p>Populace is primarily aristocrats and office workers. Colony's government officials also like to spend more time here than down below. Its policed by the corporate law with the authorisation from below government, but really its the other way around. Landing craft regularly come and go from the surface to the station. A large tanker ship comes around once a year to deliver essential goods and bring in new colonists. <br> Locations: Ship bay, luxurious living quarters, office cubical hive, station sub-system tunnels, array of emergency lifeboats, garden with a beautiful view over the planet, The Round Office of the Directors Board. </p></b>

      <p>Populace is a mix of everything, different human ethnicities as well as several more species picked either accidentally or deliberately as a part of the mission. Local government visits the surface only half the time, mostly residing in the nice quarters of the station. Its policed by the conscripted colonial militia that is trained by the corporate hirelings. The oustide equipment is mostly operated by remote controlled and preprogrammed MULEs, sealed jeeps are roaming the roads between outposts, ocasional powered cargo suit is seen outside hauling a small cargo container. <br> Locations: Town hall, residential dome slowly devolving into slums, fusion reactor, farming dome, the co-op bazar of everything, array of backup solar panels and wind turbines along the coast</p>
