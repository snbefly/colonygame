      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Locations</h1>
      <p><b>Point of Contact</b> - This was the place where the first solid camp was formed, supporting an archaeological operation that uncovered several artefacts that no equation could describe the properties of. What remains of the site is a prefab laboratory standing on the edge of a medium size quarry that is now filled with moss, toxic spores and trees in the shape of people. Nobody rescued them, the protocol did not allow. Now there stands a place of rite, encampment, where the Sacred atoned for the loss of life, swearing to bring them all back one by one.</p>
      <p><b>Drilling Facility</b> - Mining Complex of formidable size. Placed on top of a Iron deposits (and a diverse but small percentage of other mixed ores), with clay-like fertilized soil. Currently this is the main source of Colony's construction and manufacturing materials.</p>
      <p><b>Neutral Grounds</b> - This ecologists camp serves a purpouse of study and mutual exchange of information.</p>
      <p><b>Gernbernberg</b> - It seemed that they had arrived in the middle of a wild jungle, but taking a closer look, buildings became visible among the foliage. An interconnected maze of houses in and between the trees, some carved and some built with local materials.</p>
      <p><b>Druids camp</b> - A small druidic camp used as a border checkpoint and a boat pier for easy transportation.</p>
      <p><b>Scriptrock Tower</b> - Its a spiral tower molded out of plant fiber, stone, and several other unidentified material that sparkles in sunlight. Underneath it is a cave where the code of life is written. Its script was copied all around the settlements and to mark places of power. The rocks are slowly getting reclaimed by the overgrowth and inhabited by diverse and dangerous life.</p>
      <p><b>The Passage</b> - This place is a rite of passage to the knowledge of the energy. Its a place of beauty beyond human perception. A picture perfect landscape where everything seems to be in just the right place at just the right time, and yet the weather here is chaotic and ruthless, challenging everyone who comes here to earn their peace. The rumor has it the environment here becomes more and more deadly each year.</p>

      <p>
        The planet is in the last stages of ecosystem formation, this is an ideal opportunity to study and integrate civilization into its circulation. Unfortunately, this also means that the planet has bared its teeth and is ready to bite. The climate, although acceptable, is extremely contrasting from biome to biome, and the atmosphere, although is similar enough to breathe, not for very long. Volcanic activity is in the withering phase, which means that a huge amount of deposits and minerals have just formed not so deep below the surface.

      <span style="opacity: 50%;">Summer. 1 year a.c.</span>
      <p>As the dust from the facility takeover settled, the domes gradually transitioned into summer. A number of outside deaths were registered from people just cooking inside their suits, so the frequency of scout operations decreased significantly.</p>

      <p>The ecologists took the season's initiative first. Work at the neutral camp was boiling. Discoveries, good and bad. From the good ones, alien biology was finally mapped out and categorised, increasing the efficiency of treatment. But on the other hand, the intrusion into the delicate ecosystem backfired. Many sacred citizens were coming back with increased symptoms.</p>

      <p>Next on the list was the ecosystem itself, the thing they were hired to research. On such occasion Transtar offered a lucrative support contract. Teams of floran hunters were trained and instructed to capture species alive for study, which worked nicely right until they found a hunter worthy of their prowess, all the non lethal training was ignored immediately, in favour of a good old game of brutal survival. This sparked an idea, ecologists think they found a key to survival in these harsh lands. But that project will be vailed in speculations for now.</p>

      <p>In the facility meanwhile a total bureaucratic chaos took over the offices as the management shifted, it took some time for Fom and her friends to get used to the new responsibilities. They lost their home, as the company started cutting their bridges for them, harassing their friends and pigeonholing them into the new role. Scum did not take it though. An explosion echoed through the domes, delivering an impactful message for all who listened the news that day.
      </p>

      <p>But veild from everybodies eyes, the history was made behind a jungle walls. As the Keeper's pilgrimage continued, she returned from the long journey with a revalation. A plan. Laid out on paper it was called a Foundational Pact. Although  it was quite a radical move that noone has every tried before in the lineage of keepers, and they resisted the change, but this Keeper was confident.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card season">
      <h1>Season 1</h1>
      <span style="opacity: 50%;">Spring. 1 year a.c.</span>
      <p>The location for the new colony was picked to quickly re-base away from the point of contact. And by this point every bit of infrostructure was falling appart, ready to blow up and kill hundreds and suffocate thousands.</p>
      <p>A small group of scientists scavenged themselves a laboratory from old living modules and cargo containers, tacked on to a barn in the field under the farming dome. What was different about these enthusiasts was the unusual neighbors they brought with them. Florans, feral plant-like creatures who despite their appearence were extremely violent and chaotic, but the Supervisor knew that they too had their uses. </p> <p> A wave of surveys and inspections were made to figure out exactly what screws went loose and how to screw them back in place. The main threat was the "Melting Core", a name  people gave this beast of a construction. But its size did not translate to its longevity. This fusion reactor is feeding life into every corner of the colony, but its walls are falling apart, the moss is creeping, and equipment started to cover in rust. It was a ticking time bomb, leaking radiation into the slums. </p> <p> Ecologists sounded the alarm and forced the hand of management to address the issue, and then returned later for a full renovation of the place, using florans to reach places deep in the machinery, using their reverse-engineering abilities to lick the place clean. Discovering a weird moss along the way, that was the main problem of ageing. The energy flow was restored finally making power outages the thing of the past. But at a cost... one of the valuable trained florans went missing and nowhere to be found, still remains a threat to civilians in the domes.</p>
      <p>On the other side of the fence, Sacred were dealing with the aftermath of the arrival. Sickness spread among those who never knew such suffering before. They took the opportunity to trade with expeditions passing by, supplies and devices in exchange for artefacts and weird rocks. A small group of went rogue, took the weapons aquired in trade, and used them against the invaders to make a message. </p> <p> The council of the elders took their damn time to wake up to the changes, and when they did it was too late, all the aforementioned problems seeped into every part of their society. The Keeper herself traveled to the borderlands to meet the rogues in person, to speak, connect and address their suffering, where she met a group of researchers who came to talk. Problems brought by the arrival were addressed and Ecologists offered help, setting up the Neutral Grounds camp to freely share information and supplies between two parties. </p> <p> The keeper then went from settlement to settlement, rallying people to wake up to the threats, stay strong against the aliments and stay true to the code of nature. She embarked on an epic pilgrimage towards The Flicker to connect back to mother earth. Meawhile her servants welcomed visitors and resolved deals on her behalf, routing resources to the ones in need.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile somewhere in the colony your radio can catch a faint signal playing music of the old world. A radio station buried under the piles of colony infrastructure god knows where, filled with archives of the classic songs that make your blood boil with life. The people listened, endured and continued to build the foundation for the home away from home. Convicts, indebted, poor, ill, crazy. Scum of the earth. </p> <p> A if their needs not be addressed by the company, someone will. And someone did, a cell of talented dealbrokers and wiseguys stepped out to protect their families and take back the power. They set up a false front organisation Manna through which they smuggled supplies for those who need them, but the deal went awry and the organisation had to stay low for a while. But the supplies did nto stop coming, a secret chemical laboratory underground was setup to keep the people alive, and their chemist, an unusual blue skinned floran named Fom, working day and night to perfect the formula. The packaged gifts were sent out to many in need, even to druids. The network of radio relays was growing, allowing the ones on it to communicate off the grid, not silenced by the censorship. </p> <p> The Drilling Facility was the heart of the labour and people were misstreated gravely. Fom had to do something. Pulling all the strings an equipment shipment was sent out but something went wrong. An explosion in the water pumps led to panic, reveal of the intruders, and then riots broke out. But somehow, by sheer miracle, nobody got killed. A peaceful protest rippled through all social levels building Scum the support they needed to create the Union of labour.</p>
