      <h1>- Advice on play -</h1>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <b>I want to emphasize the fact that this is a pure sandbox world where every player will be attempting to achieve a specific goal. There are also always more problems than you can solve, so compromises are inevitable. If you are lost, focus on your <font color="8B1824">Needs</font>, or try to solve the threats from the Wall of notes. Play pro-actively, act dangerously, you will be rewarded. Ask questions about the world, other player’s families and characters, and you can also provide your own explanations.</b>

      <h1>- How to make a turn? -</h1>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <b>Describe what the colony wants to achieve in this time period and what it does for this. Indicate what Surpluses or properties of your community help you to do this, and whether you use special moves. The specific structure of the move is not important, the main thing is that it is clear what the colony wants to achieve with this move.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"I want to remove my need Recruits. I will make a recruitment campaign throughout the city, printing posters and making parade marches."</b>
        <p>
        <b>I will respond with: "You succeed in attracting attention to your cause. But all that preparation demands a deep pocket. If you loose your savings, the Recruits will start deserting"</b>

      <h1>- How does this system work? -</h1>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <b><font color="c2a878">Legacy: Life Among The Ruins</font> is based on worldbuilding and narrative firsthand. Therefore, the specifics about some things such as the exact amount of resources are not taken into account until it becomes critical for the narrative. In turn the world is shaped not solely by the GM, but also by the players.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <b>That said, there are some mechanics there to keep the boat afloat. Each stat says something about how you’ve adapted to the new home.</b></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b><font color="c2a878">Resources</font> are the cornerstone of your Community. Use Surpluses to boost your actions, and beware of Needs as they might explode into something bad. Surpluses are marked <font color="c2a878">Yellow</font>, and Needs are marked <font color="8B1824">Red</font>. You can find a list of all Resources down below. <br> <font color="c2a878">Reach</font> represents your Family’s influence in the wider world. Use Reach to conduct diplomacy with your allies.<br><font color="c2a878">Grasp</font> represents your Community’s ability to project force and maintain control of its assets. Use Grasp to claim new resources.<br>  <font color="c2a878">Sleight</font> represents your Community’s ability to hide their actions and misdirect others. Use Sleight to spread false information and hide your actions.<br> <font color="c2a878">Transtar Favour</font> is a measure of how much you are connected to the company's doings. High Favour will mean more tasks and rewards from Transtar, zero Favour will mean that their gains and failures do not affect you, while low Favour will mean that the company wants you out. Gain Favour by investing in the Project Transtar wants and complete their personal tasks. <br> <font color="c2a878">Artefacts</font> are the weird objects you've collected from the planet that you cant explain by laws of physics. They can be used to conduct strange rituals or power up any other action <br> <font color="c2a878">Treaty</font> is a catch all word for debts and grudges. If you have Treaty on someone, they owe you, and you can spend Treaty to force them to pay it back. They in turn can spend a Treaty on you to resist</b>

        The time is devided into <font color="c2a878">Ages</font>, which are devided into <font color="c2a878">Seasons</font>, which devided into turns, and there are 2-4 turns in a season. And the <font color="c2a878">Age</font> ends when one of the players acheives something world changing, like building a city, or discovering a new resource.

        <b><font color="c2a878">Doctrine</font> and <font color="c2a878">Lifestyle</font>. Your community’s general stance in life, and associated skills.

    <div class="container help-1"><h1>- Example Resources -</h1></div>
    <div class="container help-2">
      <h4>Attunement</h4>
      <p>Surplus: The spirits of the Land lend your House assistance, and your ancestors visit in dreams to give you advice <br>Need: You are haunted, cursed and shunned, and the Land will resent your attempts to draw on its power.</p>

      <h4>Credit</h4>
      <p>Surplus: You have the resources to obtain whatever luxury you desire, and it’s a rare bribe that strains your coffers.<br>Need: You can barely afford to pay your staff, and creditors are on the brink of knocking down your door.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Crops</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your people are fat and healthy. You can hold regular feasts for your allies and lieutenants.<br>Need: Your people are starving and riots aren’t far off. 
      </p>
      
      <h4>Defences</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your Community has measures in place to protect them from harm. This might be high walls around a settlement, guard patrols, scrap metal welded on their wagons, or rugged armour.<br> Need: Your Community’s holdings are unprotected. Saboteurs and raiders could take your stuff without much effort, your vehicles are constantly being worn down by the elements, and so on.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Engineers</h4>
      <p>Surplus: You have skilled architects and engineers able to put advanced plans together, and the skills and tools needed to construct them.<br> Need: Everything you build is in constant need of repairs and patch jobs. Making something long-lasting is almost impossible.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Herds</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your herds provide plentiful food and transport, and greatly augment your farming and logistics efforts.<br> Need: Your animals are sickly, or weak, or thinned out. Your troop movements, crop planting and logistics are greatly slowed.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Justice</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Everyone who’s done you wrong has been brought to task, and others now seek you out to advocate for them.<br> Need: There’s a longstanding grudge that demands reparations. The group that hurt you hasn’t suffered at all, while you have to deal with the harm they dealt every day.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Land</h4>
      <p>Surplus: You control a vast swath of the nation, and you’re able to keep it safe and useable. Your living areas are spacious and you have room to expand.<br> Need: You’re penned in and cramped. There’s nowhere to house new recruits, hide valuables, or build new facilities.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Leadership</h4>
      <p>Surplus: However your Community is governed, it’s working well. They may have a charismatic leader who commands loyalty, a smooth and efficient bureaucracy, or a culture of respect and understanding.<br> Need: It’s unclear who’s in charge. There’s no clear voice managing discussions, and few have a clear idea of what they’re meant to be doing at any one time.</p>
      
      
      <h4>Luxury</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your Community lives at the height of opulence. Their holdings are soft, beautiful, comfortable and desirable.<br> Need: Life is harsh. Tempers are frayed, stress is high, and it’s hard to see how tomorrow will be better than today.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Medicine</h4>
      <p>Surplus: You can treat most ailments and maladies. Even dire injuries can be dealt with, given time.<br> Need: You’re vulnerable to illness. Maybe there’s a particular plague spreading through your holdings, maybe you have weak immune systems, maybe your lifestyle leads to regular injury.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Morale</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your Community has a clear sense of shared purpose, camaraderie and fellowship. They believe in each other, and think they can work together to do great things.<br> Need: Your Community has descended into back-biting, factionalism and despair. Any attempt to organise them into a group action is likely to run into complaints, sabotage or apathy.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Peace</h4>
      <p>Surplus: You luxuriate in hard-earned peace and stability.<br> Need: It feels like every time you blink a new crisis assaults your House. Between health, safety, shelter and innumerable other concerns there’s too many fires to put them all out.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Prestige</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your Community are at the forefront of society. They’re respected, feared or beloved, and other groups welcome their presence and seek their approval.<br> Need: Your family are pariahs, disdained, or beneath other’s notice. Your people get more done when they hide their affiliation, and others respect bargains and obligations only grudgingly.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Rare Materials</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Whatever exotic resource your House needs, you have some of it in stock. Strange minerals, ancient bones, incredibly tough stones and more.<br> Need: Your family is feeling the lack of something hard to find – special feed for their pedigree horses, chemicals to fix dyes and leathers, or sacraments for their worship ceremonies.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Raw Materials</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your Community has easy access to the resources needed for large-scale construction: lumber, ores, quarries and more.<br> Need: You have to scrape and beg for the resources to repair your possessions, and any grand projects are just a pipe dream.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Recruits</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your Community is bustling with people. They may not be particularly skilled or handy, but in terms of raw manpower noone comes close.<br> Need: Maybe you have a lot of sick or wounded, maybe you’re just only a few people. Either way, you don’t have the manpower to accomplish any sort of large-scale action with finesse.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Scholars</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your Community understands more of the workings of the world than most, and have used that to improve their quality of life. They’re better able to predict the actions of the natural world, and they can plan out grand rituals to reshape the Land.<br> Need: Your family has little knowledge of how to exploit the laws of physics, alchemy or astrology. The magic of the Land is best avoided or fearfully warded against.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Scouts</h4>
      <p>Surplus: Your guards, patrols, or mapmakers ensure you’re well-informed about the surrounding area.<br> Need: There’s something in your local area that mystifies you and poses a grave threat to your House: monsters glimpsed in the undergrowth, strange stirrings underground, or gathering brigands.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Trade</h4>
      <p>Surplus: You’re the focal point of a web of caravans and merchants that spans the land. You have your finger on the pulse of commerce, and collect a healthy skimming off the top.<br> Need: You’re isolated or ostracised. Maybe traders are too scared to visit you, don’t want to risk associating with you, or they just know that you wouldn’t be able to pay.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Transport</h4>
      <p>Surplus: You have a well-maintained stable or fleet, and when your family travels they can do so swiftly and easily.<br> Need: Getting your family anywhere in a hurry is a nightmare. If they even have vehicles or mounts, they’re ill-tempered and in constant need of maintenance.
