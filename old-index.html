            <p>Populace is a mix of everything, different human ethnicities as well as several more species picked either accidentally or deliberately as a part of the mission. Local government visits the surface only half the time, mostly residing in the nice quarters of the station. Its policed by the conscripted colonial militia that is trained by the corporate hirelings.</p>
            <p>Locations: Town hall, residential dome slowly devolving into slums, fusion reactor, farming dome, the co-op bazar of everything, array of backup solar panels and wind turbines along the coast</p>
            <p>Notes: The oustide equipment is mostly operated by remote controlled and preprogrammed MULEs, sealed jeeps are roaming the roads between outposts, ocasional powered cargo suit is seen outside hauling a small cargo container.</p>

            <p>A small camp of skilled and bitter Druid Hunters that did not like how the council treated the invaders and decided to break the code and take matters in their own hands. Despite being a small encampment, the inhabitants are capable of alot of destruction. Their weapons are a mix of their homeland trickery and Transtar weaponry, fused together they make a deadly mix</p>

            <p>Somewhere in the colony your radio can catch a faint signal playing music of the old world. A radio station buried under the piles of colony infrastructure god knows where, filled with archives of the classic songs that make your blood boil with life.</p>

            <h1>The Point of Contact</h1>
            <p>This was the place where an archaeological operation uncovered several artefacts that no equation could describe the properties of. What remains of the site is a prefab laboratory standing on the edge of a medium size quarry that is now filled with moss, toxic spores and trees in the shape of people. Nobody rescued them, the protocol did not allow.

            <h5 style="opacity: 70%;">Main Colony</h5>
            <p>A name the people gave this beast of a construction. But its size did not translate to its longevity. This fusion reactor is feeding life into every corner of the colony, but its walls are falling apart, the moss is creeping, and the equipment starts to get covered in rust. Its a ticking time bomb.</p>

            <h5 style="opacity: 70%;">Main Colony</h5>
            <p>It was a temporary solution. But we all know how that goes. It was a farming barn standing in the wheat field under the colony's dome that was repurpoused for an Ecologist community to use as an HQ. It now looks like a mess of modules taped together with a workaround upon workaround. The cast of characters here is as chaotic as the building itself. Humans and Florans working together to come up with solutions to world's problems.</p>

        <b>The planet is in the last stages of ecosystem formation, this is an ideal opportunity to study and integrate civilization into its circulation. Unfortunately, this also means that the planet has bared its teeth and is ready to bite. The climate, although acceptable, is extremely contrasting from biome to biome, and the atmosphere, although is similar enough to breathe, not for very long. Volcanic activity is in the withering phase, which means that a huge amount of deposits and minerals have just formed not so deep below the surface.</b>

        If the heart of the planet is in its core, then the heart of civilization in this distant edge of the world pulsates precisely through this monumental structure hanging in the high orbit. They own the main vehicles that deliver goods and unload them to the surface of the planet, and also have a finger on the pulse of global trade and alliances. And they are here to give you the opportunity to lay the first brick in mastering this blue ball.</b>
