  		<h1>Season 1</h1>
      <span style="opacity: 50%;">Spring. 2 years a.c.</span>
      <b><p>The colony was falling apart at this point, the location was picked to quickly re-base away from the point of contact.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile a small group of scientists scavenged themselves a laboratory from old living modules and cargo containers, tacked on to a barn in the field under the farming dome. A wave of surveys and inspections were made to figure out exactly what screws went loose and how to screw them back in place. The main threat was the "Melting Core", a name the people gave this beast of a construction. But its size did not translate to its longevity. This fusion reactor is feeding life into every corner of the colony, but its walls are falling apart, the moss is creeping, and the equipment started to cover in rust. It was a ticking time bomb, leaking radiation into the slums. Ecologists sounded the alarm and forced the hand of management to address the issue, and then returned later for a full renovation of the place, using florans to reach places deep in the machinery, using their reverse-engineering abilities to lick the place clean. Discovering a weird moss along the way, that was the main problem of ageing. The energy flow was restored finally making the power outages the thing of the past.</p>
      <p>On the other side of the fence, the Druids were dealing with the aftermath of the arrival. Sickness spread among the aliens who never knew such suffering before. They took the opportunity to trade with expeditions passing by, supplies and devices in exchange for artefacts and weird rocks. A small group of went rogue, took the weapons aquired in trade, and used them against the invaders to make a message. The council of the elders took its damn time to wake up to the problem, and when they did it was too late, all the aforementioned problems seeped into every part of their society. The Keeper her self traveled to the borderlands to meet the rogues in person, to speak, connect and address their suffering, where she met a group of researchers who came to talk. Problems brought by the arrival were addressed and Ecologists offered help, setting up a Neutral Grounds camp to freely share information and supplies between two parties. The keeper then went from settlement to settlement, rallying people to wake up to the threats, stay strong against the aliments and stay true to the code of nature. She embarked on an epic pilgrimage towards The Flicker to connect back to mother earth. Meawhile her servants welcomed visitors and resolved deals on her behalf, routing resources to the ones in need.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile somewhere in the colony your radio can catch a faint signal playing music of the old world. A radio station buried under the piles of colony infrastructure god knows where, filled with archives of the classic songs that make your blood boil with life. The people listened, endured and continued to build the foundation for the home away from home. Convicts, indebted, poor, ill, crazy. Scum of the earth. A If their needs not be addressed by the company, someone will. And someone did, a cell of talented dealbrokers and wiseguys stepped out to protect their families and take back the power. They set up a false front organisation Manna through which they smuggled supplies for those who need them, but the deal went awry and the organisation had to stay low for a while. But the supplies did nto stop coming, a secret chemical laboratory underground was setup to keep the people alive, and their chemist, an unusual blue skinned floran named Fom, working day and night to perfect the formula. The packaged gifts were sent out to many in need, even to druids. The network of radio relays was growing, allowing the ones on it to communicate off the grid, not silenced by the censorship. The Drilling Facility was the heart of the labour and people were misstreated gravely. Fom had to do something. Pulling all the strings an equipment shipment was sent out but something went wrong. An explosion in the water pumps led to panic, reveal of the intruders, and then riots broke out. But somehow, by sheer miracle, nobody got killed. A peaceful protest rippled through all social levels building Scum the support they needed to create the Union of labour.</p></b>

      <p><b>The moment of the discovery of the new species split the calendar in two, we were treading on someone else's homeland. The landlords of the forests and mountains. Our people called them Druids in reference to an old folklore legend. But the first contact ended up in a misunderstanding that resulted in the loss of life for both sides.
