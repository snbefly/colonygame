        <h1>Optima</h1>
        <hr>
        <h5>Its a lively world covered by lushest jungles and dryest deserts you could find in the same place</h5>
        <p>
        The planet is in the last stages of ecosystem formation, this is an ideal opportunity to study and integrate civilization into its circulation. Unfortunately, this also means that the planet has bared its teeth and is ready to bite. The climate, although acceptable, is extremely contrasting from biome to biome, and the atmosphere, although is similar enough to breathe, not for very long. Volcanic activity is in the withering phase, which means that a huge amount of deposits and minerals have just formed not so deep below the surface.</p>

        <h1>Notable Locations</h1>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Point of Contact</b> - This was the place where the first solid camp was formed, supporting an archaeological operation that uncovered several artefacts that no equation could describe the properties of. What remains of the site is a prefab laboratory standing on the edge of a medium size quarry that is now filled with moss, toxic spores and trees in the shape of people. Nobody rescued them, the protocol did not allow. Now there stands a place of rite, encampment, where the Sacred atoned for the loss of life, swearing to bring them all back one by one.</p>
        <p><b>Drilling Facility</b> - Mining Complex of formidable size. Placed on top of a Iron deposits (and a diverse but small percentage of other mixed ores), with clay-like fertilized soil. Currently this is the main source of Colony's construction and manufacturing materials.</p>
        <p><b>Neutral Grounds</b> - This ecologists camp serves a purpouse of study and mutual exchange of information.</p>
        <p><b>Gernbernberg</b> - It seemed that they had arrived in the middle of a wild jungle, but taking a closer look, buildings became visible among the foliage. An interconnected maze of houses in and between the trees, some carved and some built with local materials.</p>
        <p><b>Druids camp</b> - A small druidic camp used as a border checkpoint and a boat pier for easy transportation.</p>
        <p><b>Scriptrock Tower</b> - Its a spiral tower molded out of plant fiber, stone, and several other unidentified material that sparkles in sunlight. Underneath it is a cave where the code of life is written. Its script was copied all around the settlements and to mark places of power. The rocks are slowly getting reclaimed by the overgrowth and inhabited by diverse and dangerous life.</p>
        <p><b>The Passage</b> - This place is a rite of passage to the knowledge of the energy. Its a place of beauty beyond human perception. A picture perfect landscape where everything seems to be in just the right place at just the right time, and yet the weather here is chaotic and ruthless, challenging everyone who comes here to earn their peace. The rumor has it the environment here becomes more and more deadly each year.</p>
