        <h5>Its a lively world covered by lushest jungles and dryest deserts you could find in the same place</h5>
        <p>
        The planet is in the last stages of ecosystem formation, this is an ideal opportunity to study and integrate civilization into its circulation. Unfortunately, this also means that the planet has bared its teeth and is ready to bite. The climate, although acceptable, is extremely contrasting from biome to biome, and the atmosphere, although is similar enough to breathe, not for very long. Volcanic activity is in the withering phase, which means that a huge amount of deposits and minerals have just formed not so deep below the surface.</p>
        <h3>Backdrop locations</h3>
        <p>Trees that scrape the clouds, thick vegetation you can drown in, field of flowers that respond to singing, cristal clear sparkling river, herds of animals synchronously migrating.</p>
