        <h1>The Domes</h1>
        <hr>
        <h5>Our new home</h5>
        <p>The Domes are a name that was given to a new colony that consists of three dome shaped areas that house the colonists. The Farming Dome provides the environment for growing essential organic suplies, The Main Dome is responsible for housing administration and mainenance facilities, as well as some high class living quarters. The Living Dome was an engineering mistake, now called the Hive, its a giant pile of modules without essential infrostructure, its a disaster breeding pit.</p>
        <p>Populace is a mix of everything, different human ethnicities as well as several more species picked either accidentally or deliberately as a part of the mission. Local government visits the surface only half the time, mostly residing in the nice quarters of the station. Its policed by the conscripted colonial militia that is trained by the corporate hirelings. The outside equipment is mostly operated by remote controlled and preprogrammed MULEs, sealed jeeps are roaming the roads between outposts, ocasional powered cargo suit is seen outside hauling a small cargo container.</p>
        <h3>Backdrop locations</h3>
        <p>Town hall, residential dome slowly devolving into slums, fusion reactor, farming dome, the co-op bazar of everything, array of backup solar panels and wind turbines along the coast</p></p>
