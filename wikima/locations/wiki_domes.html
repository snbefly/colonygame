        <h5>Our new home</h5>
        <p>Populace is a mix of everything, different human ethnicities as well as several more species picked either accidentally or deliberately as a part of the mission. Local government visits the surface only half the time, mostly residing in the nice quarters of the station. Its policed by the conscripted colonial militia that is trained by the corporate hirelings. The outside equipment is mostly operated by remote controlled and preprogrammed MULEs, sealed jeeps are roaming the roads between outposts, ocasional powered cargo suit is seen outside hauling a small cargo container.</p>
        <h1>Notable Locations</h1>

The rotation gravity allows Transtar to plaster the inside surface of the cynindrical structure with roads and buildings, which makes the view stunning as your sense of gravity evaporates looking at people walking head down above you and skyscrapers connecting the two sides.</p>
        <h5>Backdrop locations</h5>
        <p>Town hall, residential dome slowly devolving into slums, fusion reactor, farming dome, the co-op bazar of everything, array of backup solar panels and wind turbines along the coast</p></p>
