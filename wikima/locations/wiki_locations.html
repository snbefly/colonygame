        <h1>Notable Locations</h1>

        <h5>All the little places that litter this world</h5>
        <p><b>Point of Contact</b> - This was the place where the first solid camp was formed, supporting an archaeological operation that uncovered several artefacts that no equation could describe the properties of. What remains of the site is a prefab laboratory standing on the edge of a medium size quarry that is now filled with moss, toxic spores and trees in the shape of people. Nobody rescued them, the protocol did not allow.</p>
        <p><b>Neutral Grounds</b> - This ecologists camp serves a purpouse of study and mutual exchange of information.</p>
        <p><b>Gernbernberg</b> - "...it seemed that they had arrived in the middle of a wild jungle, but taking a closer look, buildings became visible among the foliage. An interconnected maze of houses in and between the trees, some carved and some built with local materials."</p>
        <p><b>Druids camp</b> - A small druidic camp used as a border checkpoint and a boat pier for easy transportation.</p>
        <p><b>Scriptrock Tower</b> - Its a spiral tower molded out of plant fiber, stone, and several other unidentified material that sparkles in sunlight. Underneath it is a cave where the code of life is written. Its script was copied all around the settlements and to mark places of power. The rocks are slowly getting reclaimed by the overgrowth and inhabited by diverse and dangerous life.</p>
        <p><b>The Passage</b> - This place is a rite of passage to the knowledge of the energy. Its a place of beauty beyond human perception. A picture perfect landscape where everything seems to be in just the right place at just the right time, and yet the weather here is chaotic and ruthless, challenging everyone who comes here to earn their peace. The rumor has it the environment here becomes more and more deadly each year.</p>
        <p><b>Floran Village</b> - Sigsn of floran activity rise in frequency around this part of the forest</p>
