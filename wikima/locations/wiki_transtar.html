        <h5>A beacon in the sky that never ceases to shine even in the storms and smog of factories.</h5>
        <p>Populace is primarily aristocrats and office workers. Colony's government officials also like to spend more time here than down below. Its policed by the corporate law with the authorisation from below government, but really its the other way around. Landing craft regularly come and go from the surface to the station. A large tanker ship comes around once a year to deliver essential goods and bring in new colonists.</p> 
        <h1>Notable Locations</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Nexus - is the middle section of the ship. The rotation gravity allows Transtar to plaster the inside surface of the cynindrical structure with roads and buildings, which makes the view stunning as your sense of gravity evaporates looking at people walking head down above you and skyscrapers connecting the two sides.</p>
        <h3>Backdrop locations</h3>
        <p>Ship bay, luxurious living quarters, office cubical hive, station sub-system tunnels, array of emergency lifeboats, garden with a beautiful view over the planet, The Round Office of the Directors Board.</p>
