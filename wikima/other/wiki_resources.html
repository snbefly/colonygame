        <h1>Surpluses and Needs</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>These are basic surpluses and needs that cover most importan strategic resources.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Artisans</h5>
        <p>Surplus: Skilled crafters, artists and performers fill your family’s holdings with well-made, beautiful things. For each part of your gear, you can name who crafted it and their particular stylistic quirks. <br>
        Need: The ability to craft useful things or appreciate aesthetics is lost to your family. Everything you own is crude and utilitarian, and you have little ability to customise equipment to fit your needs.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Wealth</h5>
        <p>Surplus: You have the resources to obtain whatever luxury you desire, and it’s a rare bribe that strains your coffers. <br>
        Need: You can barely afford to pay your staff, and creditors are on the brink of knocking down your door.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Goods</h5>
        <p>Surplus: You have a wealth of valuable items. Exotic food, jewellery, regal clothing, useful devices, and so on. Trading some here and there has raised the faction quality of life significantly.<br>
        Need: When you need to trade for something, it costs you severely every time. Anything your family doesn’t produce themselves must be carefully rationed and budgeted for.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Food</h5>
        <p>Surplus: You have an independent food source that keeps you well-fed and healthy. Whether they’re golden fields of corn, towering protein cultivators, or a storehouse of preserves, you have enough to feed your family many times over. <br>
        Need: You’re starving. Maybe you’re just isolated from any food source, or maybe nutritional deficiencies from your regular food source has led to brittle bones, jaundice and ill health.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Defences</h5>
        <p>Surplus: Your family has measures in place to protect them from harm. This might be high walls around a settlement, guard patrols or armored vehicles. <br>
        Need: Your family’s holdings are unprotected. Saboteurs and raiders could take your stuff without much effort, your vehicles are constantly being worn down by the elements, and so on.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Energy</h5>
        <p>Surplus: Your family has easy access to power. Your homes are at a comfortable temperature, you can power lights and electronics, and energy-guzzling projects are a possibility. <br>
        Need: You have few sources of fuel, and must jealously hoard those you have. Heating/air conditioning is a luxury far outside your means, and your holdings are almost entirely dark after sunset.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Engineering</h5>
        <p>Surplus: You have skilled architects and engineers able to put advanced plans together, and the skills and tools needed to construct them.<br>
        Need: Everything you build is in constant need of repairs and patch jobs at best, and that’s if you’re able to work out how to fix it. Making something long-lasting is close to impossible.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Morale</h5>
        <p>Surplus: Your family has a clear sense of shared purpose, camaraderie and fellowship. They believe in each other, and think that the family can work together to do great things. <br>
        Need: Your family has descended into back-biting, factionalism and despair. Any attempt to organise them into a group action is likely to run into complaints, sabotage or apathy.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Progress</h5>
        <p>Surplus: Your family understands more of the workings of the world than most, and have used that to improve their quality of life. They’re better able to maintain their lifestyle, and they have an idea of how to use grand projects to reshape the world. <br>
        Need: Your family has little knowledge of how to exploit the laws of physics, chemistry or biology.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Recruits</h5>
        <p>Surplus: Your family is bustling with people. They may not be particularly skilled or handy, but in terms of raw manpower no-one comes close.<br>
        Need: Maybe you have a lot of sick or wounded, maybe you’re just only a few people. Either way, you don’t have the manpower to accomplish any sort of large-scale action with finesse. At game start, a family with this has about 5-10 able-bodied adults.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Safety</h5>
        <p>Surplus: You luxuriate in hard-earned peace and stability. The struggles of survival are beginning to fade from memory.<br>
        Need: It feels like every time you blink a new crisis assaults your family. Between health, safety, shelter and innumerable other concerns there’s too many fires to put them all out, and there’s no way you can keep this up without something going very wrong.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Scouts</h5>
        <p>Surplus: Your guards, patrols, or mapmakers ensure you’re well-informed about the surrounding area. Reports regularly come in on the geography and inhabitants of the land around you.<br>
        Need: There’s something in your local area that mystifies you and poses a grave threat to your family: monsters glimpsed in the undergrowth, strange stirrings underground, or maybe a tall tower filled with strange lights radiating awful sounds.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Spies</h5>
        <p>Surplus: Your agents across the homeland send you details on the movements of factions and the dangers of the wasteland. You know more about your foes (and friends) than they can imagine.<br>
        Need: You have little idea what motivates your rivals, or what they might be up to. You’re often surprised, scooped or outmanoeuvred by those you compete with.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Trade</h5>
        <p>Surplus: You’re the focal point of a web of caravans and merchants that spans the homeland. You have your finger on the pulse of commerce, and collect a healthy skimming off the top. <br>
        Need: You’re isolated or ostracised. Maybe traders are too scared to visit you, don’t want to risk associating with you, or they just know that you wouldn’t be able to pay.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Transport</h5>
        <p>Surplus: You have a well-maintained garage or stable, and when your family travels they can do so swiftly and easily. <br>
        Need: Getting your family anywhere in a hurry is a nightmare. If they even have vehicles or mounts, they’re ill-tempered and in constant need of maintenance.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Weaponry</h5>
        <p>Surplus: You’re bristling with implements of war. Maybe you have a cache of rare and powerful weapons, an arsenal of dangerous objects looted from your defeated enemies, or a signature weapon presented to each family member as they come of age. <br>
        Need: The weapons you do have are jealously hoarded and patched up with countless repairs. Its hard to organise operations without opening up a weakness.</p>
