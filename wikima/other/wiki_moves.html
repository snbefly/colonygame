        <h1>Faction Moves</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>These are basic faction moves every faction can trigger. Most of the factions require an action to trigger, Discover Truth is free and only available once per turn, Endure is free.</p>
        <h5>CLAIM BY FORCE</h5>
        <p>When you direct your Faction to seize or maintain control of a resource, roll +Grasp. On a hit it’s theirs, but not without cost. On a 7-9 choose two of these; on a 10+, choose one:
        <ul>
        	<li> You need to commit more assets to securing it. Tie one of your surpluses to the resource – if you lose the resource, you lose the surplus and vice versa.</li>
        	<li>It’s not completely yours yet. The forces you used must stay here for a few turns. If they leave (or are removed) before then, you lose control of the resource.</li>
        	<li>There is a cost to your victory. Your faction gets a need of the GM’s choice.</li>
			<li>You hurt someone; the GM will say who, and they get 2-Treaty on you.</li>
        </ul> </p>
        <br>
        <h5>CONDUCT DIPLOMACY</h5>
        <p>When you call on your Faction's allies, say what you want from them:
        <ul>
        	<li>A meeting with one of their VIPs.</li>
        	<li>Access to a tightly-guarded location or item.</li>
			<li>Information on an opportunity or threat.</li>
        </ul> 
        If both parties positively agree to conduct it, the roll is not needed. Otherwise roll +Reach. On a hit, you get what you wanted and learn something extra from the conversation about faction goings on. On a 7-9, your agents had to get help from a third party. Say which of your allies helped them seal the deal, and give them 1-Treaty on you.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h5>SUBTERFUGE</h5>
        <p>When your Faction infiltrates other factions, say what they try to do:
        <ul>
        	<li>They make a resource appear more or less desirable.</li>
        	<li>They cause a scandal within a faction’s organisation.</li>
			<li>They hide your own involvement in an action; you may frame someone else in their place if you wish.</li>
			<li>They sabotage a particular asset, making it fail at a moment of your choosing.</li>
        </ul> 
        	Roll +Sleight. On a hit, they do it. On a 7-9 the GM names a clue you leave behind, or a family or faction that sees through the deception.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h5>DISCOVER TRUTH</h5>
        <p>Available only once per turn, but is free. When your faction is trying to puzzle out intel they have gathered, roll+Grasp if you have aquired it through scouting and boots on the ground recon, roll+Reach if you asked for information directly and consulted with other factions, roll+Sleight if your informants passed it to you from behind target's lines. On 10+ get extensive answer on the matter, and you get to ask a followup question. 7-9 you get the answer but something is missing. On a miss you get the answer but be preared for the worst.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h5>SUPPORT</h5>
		<p>When you help another House with their actions, offer them a die. If they take it, they roll alongside their own as if they had Advantage.
		<br><br>
		If your die is the highest, say how you made the difference and gain Treaty over them.
		<br><br>
		If your die is the lowest, the acting player says how you jeopardise the effort and you lose Treaty over them. 
		<br><br>
		In case of failure or partial success, you’ll share in any danger, retribution or unforeseen consequences.</p>
		<br>
		<h5>ENDURE</h5>
		<p>To endure you dont have to spend an acton. Instead your Faction will do its best to group up against the concequenses of a threat and act defensively. Substract the ammount of Needs you have from the ammount of Surpluses, then roll with that modifier. On a hit you’re able to react to the danger and pick 1: 
		<ul>
			<li>Understand the threat, and gain fleeting Advantage acting on this knowledge.</li>
			<li>Erase a Surplus right now to completely prevent the damage.</li>
			<li>Call out for support. Whichever faction is most willing and able to respond says how they mitigate the danger, and gains Treaty over you.</li>
		</ul>
		on a 10+ triumph unites you, gain a Surplus of your choice. 7-9</p>
		<br>
		<h5>CALL IN DEBT</h5>
		<p>
			When you call on an obligation another Family has to you, spend 1 Treaty and choose one:
			<ul>
				<li>Gain +2 on a move that targets them.</li>
				<li>Take a Surplus from them.</li>
				<li>Get them to back you up, fall into indecision, or protect something important.</li>
			</ul>
			Player families can resist by spending 1-Treaty on you, or Endure if they have none.
