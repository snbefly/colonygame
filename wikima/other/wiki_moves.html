        <h5>CLAIM BY FORCE</h5>
        <p>When you direct your Faction to seize or maintain control of a resource, roll +Grasp. On a hit it’s theirs, but not without cost. On a 7-9 choose two of these; on a 10+, choose one:
        <ul>
        	<li> You need to commit more assets to securing it. Tie one of your surpluses to the resource – if you lose the resource, you lose the surplus and vice versa.</li>
        	<li>There is a cost to your victory. Your family gets a need of the GM’s choice.</li>
			<li>You hurt someone; the GM will say who, and they get 2-Treaty on you.</li>
        </ul> </p>
        <h5>CONDUCT DIPLOMACY</h5>
        <p>When you call on your Faction's allies, say what you want from them:
        <ul>
        	<li>A meeting with one of their VIPs.</li>
        	<li>Access to a tightly-guarded location or item.</li>
			<li>Information on an opportunity or threat.</li>
        </ul> 
        If both parties positively agree to conduct it, the roll is not needed. Otherwise roll +Reach. On a hit, you get what you wanted and learn something extra from the conversation about faction goings on. On a 7-9, your agents had to get help from a third party. Say which of your allies helped them seal the deal, and give them 1-Treaty on you.
		</p>
		<h5>SUBTERFUGE</h5>
        <p>When your Faction infiltrates other factions, say what they try to do:
        <ul>
        	<li>They make a resource appear more or less desirable.</li>
        	<li>They cause a scandal within a Family’s/Faction’s organisation.</li>
			<li>They hide your own involvement in an action; you may frame someone else in their place if you wish.</li>
			<li>They sabotage a particular asset, making it fail at a moment of your choosing.</li>
        </ul> 
        	Roll +Sleight. On a hit, they do it. On a 7-9 the GM names a clue you leave behind, or a family or faction that sees through the deception.
		</p>
		<h5>DISCOVER TRUTH</h5>
        <p>When your Faction is trying to puzzle out intel they have gathered, roll+Grasp if you have aquired it through scouting and boots on the ground recon, roll+Reach if you asked for information directly and consulted with other factions, roll+Sleight if your informants passed it to you from behind target's lines. On 10+ get extensive answer on the matter, and you get to ask a followup question. 7-9 you get the answer but something is missing. On a miss you get the answer but be preared for the worst.
		</p>
