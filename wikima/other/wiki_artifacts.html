          <h5>Drudic steel. Transtar R&D documentation notes.</h5>
          Requires minor but constant stream of magical energy, in an active state it withstands impact and pressures well. Electricity also gives this effect, but with a large loss of efficiency. At a distance of thousands of kilometers from the nearest dense tropical biome it completely loses its efficiency. <br><br>

          <h5>Vibrating stone. Translated excerpt from a druidic catalogue.</h5>
          Sound transducer, microphone transmitter, speaker. Performs many different functions. There are also variations that exude visual illusion. Especially rare versions have a full package of sensory reproduction, sometimes capable of creating a whole image of a living creature. <br><br>

          <h5>Nourishing herbs. Translated excerpt from a druidic catalogue.</h5>
          This seasoning added to food makes it feel much more filling. It has a temporary energizing effect on the body that wears off over time. <br><br>

          <h5>Thermal cloak. Translated excerpt from a druidic catalogue.</h5>
          Most often appears in the form of a robe or tunic made of black silk with blue lines on it. These clothes have the effect of warming and cooling the wearer, as well as cheerfulness and comfort. <br><br>

          <h5>Protective thermal cloak. Translated excerpt from a druidic catalogue.</h5>
          Thermal cloak with sewn-in mage steel inserts. This cloak requires the wearer's spiritual energy for a protective effect, and the presence of the spirit of the Forest around, otherwise it is just heated rags. Those rare examples that exist are presented in the form of tunics of white silk with blue and gold lines on it. <br><br>

          <h5>Cutter. Translated excerpt from a druidic catalogue.</h5>
          Sword, spear, ax and any of the colony's tools + the effect of easy cutting of materials. Without magic or a charge of magic, it is a common tool. When a magician throws not particularly strong magical currents into an instrument, or when a magic battery is connected to the instrument, the instrument or tool breaks the integrity of the material much more easily. The stronger and denser the material, the more magic is required. Weapons made of ice, wood, bone, obsidian, or diamond conduct and store magic much better than other materials. However, the strength remains the same. Wood and obsidian materials are the most popular among the druids.</p>
