        <h1>Races of Optima</h1>
        <hr>
        <h5>Humans</h5>
        <p>Humans hail from the planet Earth. <br>

        The ability to travel quickly between the stars soon led to a post-scarcity society, using advanced technology in the goal of exploration and advancement of learning. <br><br>

        During the time of exploration two major groups came to prominence: the altruistic Terrene Protectorate, which sought to assist and welcome beings of any race for the betterment of all life in the universe, and the Universal Space Corporate Military. The latter eventually collapsed after a long string of bad luck followed by a catastrophic bioweapon failure. Its assets were divided among many different corporations that sprung from its corpse.</p>

        <h5>Dwarfs</h5>
        <p>Unlike most other races, dwarves originally came from the subterranean tunnels beneath the world, and emerged on the surface thousands of years before they the human colonial expansion.</p>

        <h5>Florans</h5>
        <p>Plant-based humanoids, they are extremely violent carnivores with no central government or power structure, split into numerous tribes spread across the universe, each led by a Greenfinger. Though they are biologically a single-sex race, they may adapt sexually dimorphic physical traits and male/female identities if they so choose. Their speech is often simplistic, and they tend to hisss their sibilantsss. Their primary drives are hunting, acquiring trophies, fighting, eating meat, and more hunting. It is speculated that their general casual view towards killing and consuming other intelligent species stems from not viewing "meat" as "alive" in the same sense they are. However, as the Floran spread throughout the galaxy, more and more individuals are recognizing a need to integrate, make friends, and maybe not stab anyone that slightly inconveniences them. <br><br>

        A relatively young race, they have primitive technology but are incredibly adept at scavenging and—thanks to the Greenfingers' unique gifts—reverse-engineering other races' tech, much to the universe's chagrin.</p>

        <h5>Druids</h5>
