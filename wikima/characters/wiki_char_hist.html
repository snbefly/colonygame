            <h4>Appearence</h4>
              <p>Unremarkable green floran with slight pink hue of his carapace. Usually wearing a long duster over his body concealing some of his arsenal. Almost always have a slight uncanny grin regardless of situation at hand. Has a large walkman player at his belt that usually plays loud obnoxious music. </p>
            <h4>Origin</h4>
              <p>He has many names, Butcher of Dalih, Joke the Ripper, Neon Drifter, Undead Anacrhist, Pot... But most people who know him well enough to be around and feel safe call him Hist. He is armed and dangerous criminal with unknown origins and motives, moved apparently just by his thirst for blood, gore and violence, leaving most of his victims scorched and teared apart, not uncommonly filled with bite marks. He has an bounty on his head and a big criminal record, starging with acts of industrial terrorism including underground factories exploiting floran slaves for profit where he almoust died, but records showed he was saved amoung other florans by mistirious blue floran lady. Its unclear who he really works for and what he wants. But its clear he is vicious killer and a hunter.</p>

              <p>List of his crimes include but not limited to: Coercion, extortion, extinctions, distortions, desertions, perversions, illegal insertions, invasions of nation's , space excavation, tax evations, commotions, explotions, explodions, and... loitering?...</p>
