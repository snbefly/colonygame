            <h4>Appearence</h4>
              <p>This green-skinned, red-leafed Floran does not seem to stay with any specific attire or equipment for long, but more often than not she is seen among her kin, taking an active role in guiding and leading them. While her role among her tribe isn't clear, the way they often refer to her as Captain and the way they let her do the thinking hints toward her being a Floran with exceptional experience.</p>
            <h4>Origin</h4>
              <p>Nula was formally one of the Florans in a supervisor role under the employ of the Ecologists, who revealed her to be one of the first Florans in their team and an ideal laboratory assistant. Nula had apparently approached the Ecologists with the idea and it is unknown where she came from beforehand.</p>
