            <h4>WORK HARD</h4>
            <p>When you assess a disaster, crisis, or hardship, name the inglorious task that can sort things out and roll +Roles marked. On a 7-9, you can gather your crew and perform the task, but choose two. On a +10, choose one:
              <ul>
                <li>It’s too complex. You will need support from a highly skilled artisan or scholar.</li>
                <li>It’s too big. You’ll need to recruit dozens more strong arms.</li>
                <li>It’s too dangerous. Your crew might not survive it.</li>
                <li>It’s too costly. There’s a Surplus you must expend to succeed.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>

        <div class="card character-move ">
          <h4>AS ONE</h4>
          <p>Your reputation draws followers from far and wide: your starting Companions gain the Horde and Hardy tags. When a new Cycle starts, your crew gets larger – gain new Companions with a free tag, in addition to Horde and Hardy.</p>

          <h4>110%</h4>
          <p>You can decide to overcharge a piece of your equipment to perform beyond its safe settings. You get advantage on a next roll using that piece of tech, but choose one.
            <ul>
              <li>It goes haywire, affecting far more than you desired.</li>
              <li>It’s damaged and must be repaired in a place of safety.</li>
              <li>Its effect turns on you, leaving you with lingering physical trauma.</li>
