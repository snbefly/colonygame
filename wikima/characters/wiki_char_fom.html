            <h4>Appearence</h4>
              <p>Short and slim floran with unusually blue carapace and petals. Wearing attire more akin to a field doctor rather than a rebel leader. Keeping most of the time shy and sucluded stance. Sometimes wears a motorbyke helmet.</p>
            <h4>Origin</h4>
              <p>Little known about this floran, most public records about her ether contradicting eachother or simply non-existing. But earliest traces of her identity link her to chemical plant utilising unauthorised floran labor for production of nitric fertilisers, where eerly similar to her apperance floran once worked. After of indecent with terrorist attack majority of florans were exposed to the chemicals, dying horribly due to overexposure, few survivors gone insane attacked the guards and eachother, with one exeption. Camera footage shows now blue due to chemical damage floran has entered facility in order to save her few slave brethering who survived the attack and hide in the sewers, just to dissapear for years. Investigation of her futher activity reveals her to become quite a talented chemist and a underground doctor, some reports linking her to production of drugs and stealing of Transtar property, as well as smuggling illegal recreational substenties on the station but investigation was shut down by higher ups.</p>

            <p>LEAD TO GOLD
              Given a few hours and access to fine chemicals, you can accomplish great things. Choose a main feature:
              <ul>
                <li>Reagent that can detect any trace of __________</li>
                <li>An agent to neutralise harmful effects of __________</li>
                <li>A catalyst to activate a hidden potential in __________</li>
                <li>Destruction of whatever it’s applied to.</li>
              </ul>
              The GM will choose one downside:
              <li>Someone needs to stay up with it to make sure reaction starts.</li>
              <li>It’ll require some potent compound.</li>
              <li>The reaction is slow burning.</li>
